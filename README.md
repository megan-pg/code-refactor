# code-refactor
Code-refactor is the first homework assignment given in the Coding Bootcamp course. It's goals are to help student's identify the different elements to help screen readers and other coders read what's on the webpage. Divs create divisions in the content of a page, but are generic and do not identify what the content is. 
Elements such as, nav, section, aside, main, footer, all tell what each content areas is so the code is easier to understand and can be identified correctly for the visually impaired (when using a screen reader). 
In this assignment, a webpage was set up only using divs and the student had to identify the header, 3 sections, an aside, a footer, and enter in alt text (to identify pictures on the page for the screen reader).
